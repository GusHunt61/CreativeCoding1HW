CLI and GUI are two types of interface. CLI stands for Command Line Interface, this means that whatever you type into the terminal is what the computer will translate into whatever you want it to. CLI is usually used for things like code (JavaScript, Python, C#). GUI on the other hand, stands for Graphic User Interface, these types of program are used for visual coding (Unreal Engine Blueprints). GUI also includes things like windows, scrollbars, video game interfaces, etc.. There are many differences between GUI and CLI, the first one being, CLI is the actual code, in its original form. GUI is a visual interpretation, or output of CLI. GUI is used in some types of programming and visual media creation, almost all video game design software are powered by GUI, while very few are powered by CLI. Some software have the ability to be powered by either CLI, or GUI, one example of this kind of software is Unreal Engine. Unreal Engine can be powered by the programming language C++ (CLI), or the visual coding language Blueprints (GUI). Some pros to using CLI are that it is faster, and more precise. And some pros to GUI are that it is easier and more user friendly.
