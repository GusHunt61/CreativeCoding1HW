What affected me the most about this lecture was how he would be persistent and continue working, even though he would hit a brick wall. This type of enthusiasm helped him a lot during his journey of being a game developer and a professor. Every time he came up against a challenge where someone told him that he could not progress further, he tried again and inevitably succeeded. His messages of being happy, and a good person who fulfills other people's dreams and gives them the resources necessary to succeed was truly astounding. His teaching practices, and projects he has worked on have influenced thousands. I myself grew up using the tool Alice (albeit a later version called “Alice 2”) which was the beginning of my interest in programming. Because of this tool which he created, I started down the road of video game development, which will be a massive part of my life in the future, as I hope to someday be an independent game developer.
