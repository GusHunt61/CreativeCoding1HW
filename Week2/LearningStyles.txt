Learning styles are a way of knowing how other people and ourselves learn about things. It is a knowledge which can greatly improve your productivity and ability to function in a learning habitat. After a few tests which I have taken at different times, it shows that I am mostly a visual learner, but I also learn very well from hearing or reading things. The way learning styles can affect the way we learn is that someone who is a kinesthetic learner might be more able to do things physically, a visual learner might be able to do things by seeing them, and an auditory learner can learn things by reading or hearing about them.
