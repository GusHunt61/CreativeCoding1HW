I will make a short, 2d horror game in p5.js. I will use inspiration from the surrealist movement, specifically the parts of it that feel like dreams, nightmares, or distant memories. I know that I will have to overcome problems with trying to add dialogue, also I will have trouble adding scene changes or still images. I will learn to use the 3d geometries in p5.js to add some other surrealist elements and add to the story.
